Original files came from 
https://retro64.altervista.org/blog/an-introduction-to-vector-based-graphics-the-commodore-64-rotating-simple-3d-objects/
    vector_05_bigger2_y_v2.s: XY rotation
    vector_05_v2.s: Y rotation only

Building requires cc65.

Do 'make cube2' to create a demo disk of the optimized cube.
Do 'make glxgears' to create a demo disk of glxgears.
Do 'make run' to run the demo disk in the emulator.
